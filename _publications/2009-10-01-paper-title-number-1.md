## Abstract

Predicting the results of cricket matches, especially in the fast-paced Twenty20 (T20) format, is both challenging and important in sports analytics. In this context, machine learning plays a vital role in analyzing complex patterns and improving prediction accuracy.

This paper aims to predict the winners of the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL), a major T20 cricket tournament, using machine learning methods. Four machine learning models were used: **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, **Gradient Boosting**, and **XGBoost**. These models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, based on historical data from several BPL seasons. The dataset included important details such as team scores, number of wickets, toss results, venues, and team performance statistics.

Among the models, **Gradient Boosting** and **XGBoost** delivered the best results, with prediction accuracies of **97.73%** and **97.70%**, respectively. These findings show that advanced models, particularly ensemble methods, are better at capturing the complex nature of cricket matches. This helps improve the accuracy of match predictions in the BPL and demonstrates how machine learning can be effectively applied in real-world sports scenarios.

The results are valuable for teams, analysts, and fans, and can support the development of more accurate live match prediction systems in the future.
